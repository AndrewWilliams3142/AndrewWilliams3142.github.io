I am a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](http://www.ml.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, co-advised by [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/){:target="_blank"} and
[Barnabàs Pòczos](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/){:target="_blank"}.

My PhD research focuses on developing algorithms for machine learning, mainly focused on semi-supervised, curriculum learning, and graph-based problems. I am also passionate about applying machine learning methods in neuroscience, in order to study how the brain understands language and controls speech. Previously, I did some research in Computer Vision, with the goal of detecting and tracking objects in videos.

Before I joined CMU, I graduated with an [M.Phil. in Advanced Computer Science](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs){:target="_blank"} from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, UK.
In my Master's thesis I used Machine Learning methods to detect and align chromosomes in microscope images, advised by [Pietro Lió](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/){:target="_blank"}.
