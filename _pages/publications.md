Hi there! I'm a PhD student in Climate Physics at the University of Oxford, where my advisor is [Prof. Philip Stier](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/stier){:target="\_blank"}.

My research uses **global climate models** to understand how our planet responds to changes in **aerosols** (e.g. from pollution or wildfires) and **greenhouse gases** (e.g. CO$$ _{2} $$). I'm particularly interested in understanding how clouds and large-scale circulation mediate these effects.
